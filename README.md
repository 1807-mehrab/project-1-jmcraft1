Just finished what I could at quarter to 5. Sorry didn't have time to comment code. That was my intention. Didn't get picture upload
working for the host or customer update profile. But I did get the customer to be able to update password. The first page is index.html 
where you log in and the dao checks to see if you are a customer or employee and directs to the proper home screen accordingly. Each 
of the two homescreens have different sections where all the user stories can be done, or at least most of them. I had trouble keeping 
the user email from log in to store in home screen, so whenever a customer needs to do something, they need to enter their email on 
the appropriate form.
